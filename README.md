# Systeme Expert L2 project: Animals.
### This project is based on the [Prolog] language (https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog). It consisted in creating an expert system on the subject of our choice (here animals). The expert system must, after a series of questions, find the animal the user is thinking of.

The expert system has a base of animals and their evolutionary characteristics.  
Depending on the answers, it automatically eliminates certain impossible cases (such as vertebrate/invertebrate) and continues to ask questions about the animal that so far matches the criteria.  
Once an animal has been established, it explains how it was found. 

Here are the [slides in pdf format](/systeme_expert_prolog.pdf) and the [tex file](/systeme_expert_prolog.tex) source.  

Here's the [prolog file](/Projet.pl)  and two demonstration videos on [the lion](/lion.mp4) and [the bee](/abeille.mp4).
